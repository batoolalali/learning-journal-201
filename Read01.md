# Introducton to HTML & CSS
Understanding HTML and CSS helps anyone who works with the web, it's not that hard to learn how
to write web pages and read the code. 

### Ways to access the web:
- Browsers: software to access websites, such as Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Chrome.

- Web Servers: When user asks the browser to access a web page, the request is sent
across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.

- Devices: desktop computers, laptops, tablets, and phones.

- Screen readers: programs that read out the contents of a computer screen to a user.

When user visit a website the browser will first connect to DNS server to find the location of the web server.

### How the web works

1- User connects to the web via an Internet Service
Provider (ISP), types a
domain name or web address into the browser to visit a site.

2- The browser will first connect to DNS server to find the location of the web server, they tell your computer the IP address associated with the requested domain name.

3- IP allows browser to contact the web server that hosts the website you requested.

4- The web server then sends the page you requested back to your web browser.

### HTML pages is a text documents.
- Headings:  The use of headings and subheadings in any document often reflects a hierarchy of information.
- Tags act like containers. They tell you something about the information that lies between their opening and closing tags.

### Elements
- <DOCTYPE>
to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using

- <!-- COMMENT -->

- Class and id attrribute:

  - ID: Every HTML element can carry the id attribute. It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
  - Class: Every HTML element can also carry a class attribute. Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different from the other elements on the page.

- Block elements: will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. Such as <h1>  <p>  <ul>  and <li> 
- Inline elements: will always appear to continue on the same line as their neighbouring elements. Such as <a>  <b>  <em>  and <img> 

- the <div> element allows you to group a set of elements together in one block-level box.
- the <spam> allows you to group a set of elements together, but it is an inline element.
- the <ifram> to cut another page into your page in a little window.
- the <meta>  element It is not visible to users lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page.
- Escape characters are used to include special.



### HTML Layout

HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page.

- the <header> <footer>
The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.

- the <nav>
Used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.

- The <article> element acts as a container for any section of a page.

- the <aside>
  - When the <aside> element is used inside an <article> element, it should contain information that is related to the
    article but not essential to its overall meaning. 

  - When the <aside> element is used outside of an <article> element, it acts as a container for content that is related to the entire page.

- the <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading.

When you design wyour website you have to know your target audience and why they would come to your site, what 
they want to find in your website and when they are likely to return.

- Site maps helps in structure planning of a site.
- Wireframes helps in organizing the information that will need to go on each page.
- Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.

### The ABC of Programming

A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal, it is made up instructions a computer can follow step-by-step.

- How to write a script?
  1. Define the goal.
  2. Design the script.
  3. Code each step.

Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your program must let the computer solve the task programmatically and break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed
to complete that task.

### Objects and Properties
- Objects: In computer programming, each physical thing in the world can be represented as an object.
Each object can have its own properties, enents and methods, they create together a working model of that object.

- Properties: they are the characteristics of the an object. Each property has a name and a value, tells something about
each object.

- Event is the computer's way of to tell that something just happened!

- Methods: represent how people interact with an object. thet tell you something about that object or change the value of one or more of that object's properties.


Computers use data to create models of things in the real world.
The events, methods, and properties of an object all relate to each other:
Events can trigger methods, and methods can retrieve or update an object's properties.


### HOW HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT FIT TOGETHER

- HTML gives the page structure and adds semantics.
- CSS enhances the HTML page with rules that state how the HTML content is presented.
- JS is where we can change how the page behaves, adding interactivity.
